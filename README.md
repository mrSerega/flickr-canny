# Flickr Canny edge detection wizard

## Quick start

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`
3. ...
4. Enjoy

## Why

1. App based on create-react-app script because it is the fastest way to establish such project
2. Used react + typescript, React is a requirement, typescript allows to strictly control types and minimize stupids on prebuild stage
3. Decided not to use redux, cause it's an overkill here
4. Could spend more time for structure it properly, like decompose App for more components, like ModalWindow and ImageItem, however it takes time, so it's sort of in backlog
5. Used functional components, cause it allows to write less code and in general it's more common in modern react
